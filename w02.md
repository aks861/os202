# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [Security and Protection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-security-and-protection/)<br>
Security is a measure of confidence that the integrity of a system and
its data will be preserved. It deals with external threats such as malware, virus, worms, etc. 
Meanwhile, protection is a set of mechanism that control the access
of processes and users to the resource defined by a computer system. These Mechanism must provide
a means for specifying the controls to be imposed together with a means of enforcement. 

2. [Malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware)<br>
Malware (malicious software) is software designed to exploit, disable
or damage computer systems. Basically, any software that is harmful to systems.
Trojan horse, spyware, ransomware, virus, and worms are malwares.

3. [Denial of Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)<br>
Denial of Service attack is an attack in which the attacker tried to make the service unavailable to the user
by disrupting services of a host connected to the internet. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks
is a type of denial of service attack which are launched from many different sources at once.

4. [Cryptography](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cryptography)<br>
Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only 
the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents.

5. [Encryption](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/encryption#:~:text=Encryption%20is%20the%20method%20by,encrypted%20data%20is%20called%20ciphertext.)<br>
Encryption is the method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning.
In Symmetric-key encryption the message is encrypted by using a key and the same key is used to decrypt the message.
Meanwhile, Asymmetric Key Encryption, also known as public key encryption, uses two different key to encrypt and decrypt the message.

6. [User authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication)<br>
User authentication is a process of identifying a user whether the user is authentic or not. It usually based on
3 things: User's knowledge of something (e.g password), something the user has (e.g key, card), or an attribute
of user (e.g fingerprint, retina).  

7. [Principle of Least Privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)<br>
Principle of least privilege is a principle that every user, process, or a program be given just enough access to do its purpose.
This idea can minimized the amount of harms in case of failures.

8. [Access Matrix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-matrix-in-operating-system/)<br>
Access Matrix is a security model of protection state that is used to define the rights of each process executing in the domain with respect to each object.
Columns represent different system resources and rows represent different protection domains. 
Entries within the matrix indicate what access that domain has to that resource.

9. [Goals of Protection](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/14_Protection.html)<br>
The goals of protection is to prevent malicious misuse of the system by users or programs,
to ensure that each shared resource is used only in accordance with system policies, 
to ensure that errant programs cause the minimal amount of damage possible.


10. [Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy)<br>
Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves
or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively.
One of the privacy aspects is limited access. Limited access means the ability of person
to participate in society without having others collect information about them.
