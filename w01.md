# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Virtual Machine](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/virtual-machines)<br>
A virtual machine is an emulation of a physical computer. They are often referred to as a guest while the physical machine they run on is referred to as the host.

2. [Virtual Memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
Virtual Memory is a storage allocation scheme in which secondary memory can be addressed as though it were part of main memory
which creates the illusion of a very large main memory.

3. [Vi](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br>
Vi is a text editor that has two modes: command mode and insert mode. The commands that I used the most during this week is I to insert the text, d to delete, 
and :x to save and quit.

4. [Bash (shell)](https://www.mediacollege.com/linux/command/shell-command.html)<br>
Bash is a command processor that let us write commands. Prior to this, I already knew some basic bash commands
such as cd, ls, mkdir, rm, and mv. The new commands that I used during this week is history, alias, and cat.

5. [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software)<br>
Free software is a software that have these for freedoms.
Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute and make copies so you can help your neighbour.
Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

6. [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)<br>
Open source is a broad software license that makes source code available to the general public with relaxed or non-existent restrictions on the use and modification of the code.

7. [copy left](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html)<br>
Copyleft is a general method for making a program (or other work) free (in the sense of freedom, not “zero price”), and requiring all modified and extended versions of the program to be free as well.

8. [Hypervisor](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-a-hypervisor)<br>
A hypervisor is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor, sometimes called a virtual machine manager (VMM), allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.

9. Hypervisor Types<br>
Type 0 hypervisors are implemented in the hardware and require
modifications to the operating system to ensure proper operation.<br>
Type 1 hypervisors provide the environment and features needed to create, run, and manage guest virtual machines.<br>
Type 2 hypervisors are simply applications that run on other operating
systems, which do not know that virtualization is taking place.<br>

10. Virtualization<br>
Virtualization is a method for providing a guest with a duplicate of a
system’s underlying hardware. Multiple guests can run on a given system,
each believing that it is the native operating system and is in full control. Source: OSC Book
